# luggage-and-found
Sample application where users can create an account and create a 'Luggage Tag'. This virtual tag contains information about a flight for exmaple. Each Tag has q unique QR code.
This code can be printed and stick on the luggage.

Users can report the luggage as missing.
If someone scans the QR code when he/she finds the luggage, they will be redirected to the website and shown the current status of the luggage. If the luggage is reported missing the person can report that he/she found it and send a short message.
The user will see this message and can get the luggage and report the luggage is returned (OK).

Note: this is just an prove of concept to try some QR generation..;-)
